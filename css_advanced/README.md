# CSS Advanced Project

## Project Description

This project focuses on styling a webpage based on the design provided in Figma. The HTML structure has been implemented in a previous assignment, and now we will focus on enhancing the look and feel using custom CSS.

The goal is to match the design specifications from the Figma file and apply styles such as fonts, colors, layout, and responsive design.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the webpage.
- `style.css`: Contains the custom CSS styles applied to the webpage.
- `script.js`: Contains any JavaScript (if required for functionality).
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions.

## Requirements

- The project must be built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- No external libraries such as Bootstrap, React, or Node.js are allowed.
- The project must follow the design in Figma and use the fonts "Source Sans Pro" and "Spin-Cycle-OT."
- All files should be W3C compliant and validate with the W3C Validator.
- A `README.md` file is included to describe the project.
- All code files should end with a new line.
